    title: Fastest tracking ever
    comment: Never been a big app guy because it slows me down to track by typing so much stuff in (plus sweaty and shaky hands mid workout arenâ€™t good) but the single touch tracking for sets is great in this app, plus I appreciate the calculated one rep maxes!

    title: Love this app!
    comment: The content is awesome, I LOVE this app. Itâ€™s really easy to track the workout data. I have tried a number of other exercise apps and itâ€™s the best app.
